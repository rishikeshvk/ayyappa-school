    <h2>Activities</h2>
    <h3>Art and Craft</h3>
    <p>The Art and Craft Department is committed to the cause of nurturing creative thinking and artistic growth, through inspiring instructions and a structured goal-oriented curriculum. Creativity is an inborn quality in children. Teachers guide
      and encourage them to explore and exhibit their hidden talent and artistic potential from the budding stages to develop as blooming artists.</p>
    <p> <strong>Art Education</strong> in the pre-primary classes begins with learning and identifying different colours. The foundation course at the Primary school level is based on encouraging the students to explore the drawing skills, understand
      the theory of colours and colouring concepts to get acquainted with the usage of various colouring materials, while practicing the art of blending colours. </p>
    <p>The core activity at the Secondary School level is designed to enhance the visual knowledge of perspective drawings, to produce skillful 2D and 3D sketches and illustrations with creative applications of pencil, colour and paint techniques.
    </p>
    <p> <strong>Craft Education</strong> in the primary classes begins with pasting various materials. The activity at the Secondary School level is designed to enhance the practical knowledge by making paper flowers and garlands, designing a
      handkerchief, making cushions, etc. </p>
    <p>The designing skill in art and craft is evident in the various posters, props and models created for all annual events and fests, displaying an artistic touch of excellence.</p><br>
    <h3>Scouts And Guides</h3>
    <p>The purpose of the Scouts and Guides Movement is to contribute to the development of young people in achieving their full physical, intellectual, social and spiritual potentials as individuals, as responsible citizens and as members of local,
      national and international communities.</p>
    <p>Their duty is adherence to spiritual principle, loyalty to the religion that expresses the acceptance of the duties resulting there from and also responsibility for the development of one’s self.</p>
    <p>Students from Class VI to X can join this movement.</p><br>
    <h3>Cubs And BulBuls</h3>
    <p>Cubs and bulbuls is the next lap in the journey towards Scouting and Guiding Character building is its aim. Instilling self – discipline and thoughtfulness for others at a tender age, is the major focus of the activities designed for this
      group. It prepares the boys and girls to take up bigger tasks in scouting and guiding and also helps in their mental and physical growth. Children learn to be independent and to live life in a disciplined manner. Students of std I – V can join
      this movement.</p><br>
    <h3>Smart Class</h3>
    <p> <q>Continuity gives us roots, re- invention helps us create the future</q><br>At SAEC (CBSE) we have the Educomp Smart class which brings technology into the classroom. It empowers the teachers with well researched, mapped to the curriculum
      digital modules which the teacher could project right in the classrooms to elucidate and explain concepts. The results are nothing short of amazing. </p>
    <p>Classrooms come alive and the perennial tug of war between the teachers challenges to explain and students struggle to understand give way to an inspired participation in the journey of discovering new concepts.</p><br>
    <h3>NIE</h3>
    <p>Newspaper in education is introduced in SAEC (CBSE). Students from classes V to X subscribe Deccan Herald and Times Of India, Students edition. Reading newspaper has helped the students to update their knowledge about current affairs, improve
      general knowledge and vocabulary. Moreover it provides a platform for the students to participate in inter school competitions such as art, dance, quiz, literary activities etc. The newspaper is also useful for the students for school
      activities as they get additional information related to their core subjects.</p><br>
    <h3>Yoga</h3>
    <p>We also have yoga classes in SAEC. In simple words, yoga means giving care to your body, mind and breath. This means that the century-old practice includes yoga postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayamas) and meditation. Through
      these, the body, mind and breath come in harmony with each other.</p>
