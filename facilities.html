    <h3>Classroom</h3>
    <p>Each classroom houses a large area and is designed in such that every student gets the teacher's maximum individual attention.
      There are 41 classrooms for regular teaching alone and a number of other rooms like Resource rooms to facilitate better learning.
      Classrooms are well-ventilated with huge windows and they offer the right atmosphere for learning. The green boards and bulletin boards placed
      at vantage points, make learning easier and interesting. The strength of each class is kept at a manageable level and the comfortable furniture adds to the ambience of the classroom.</p><br>
    <h3>Library</h3>
    <p>The library is the main resource center for the students and the faculty at Sree Ayyappa Education Centre (CBSE). The library is located on the ground floor of the main building, with a seating capacity of over 75 students.</p>

    <p><strong>Textbook collection: </strong>Syllabus-based textbooks from different authors help the students to self-study the subject in greater detail and also help the teachers to teach the subjects from different angles and give extra
      information on any given topic.</p>
    <p><strong>Fiction collection: </strong>A large number of fiction titles by leading authors such as Roald Dahl, Enid Blyton are available for the primary section and authors such as Shakespear, Sherlok Holmes , Ruskin Bond, etc are available for
      the Senior sections.</p>
    <p><strong>Reference books: </strong>A collection of Encyclopedias, dictionaries, atlases etc. are available to the students and the teachers for their day to day teaching and assignment work.</p>

    <h3>Maths Lab</h3>
    <p>A well-equipped Maths Lab provides students with the opportunity to have fun with numbers.</p>
    <p>It creates a challenging atmosphere for students to put their mathematical abilities to test and enhances their analytical reasoning and lateral thinking through various games and activities. We instill and develop the observation skills among
      students to derive formulae.</p>
    <p>In the Math Lab, games are organized, models made, quizzes conducted, projects exhibited, all learning process done through practical means.
      For classes 1 to 8, experiments are done based on the concepts dealt in the syllabus. Various Kits are designed and they are used to derive the formulae. For classes 9 and 10, students work on different math experiments, which are given by
      NCERT syllabus. Students are also marked based on the Math Lab activities.</p><br>
    <h3>Computer Lab</h3>
    <p>Computer education is an integral part of the curriculum. The computer laboratory with 20 systems is very popular with the students. Students are trained to learn the latest software applications and programming languages. The school offers
      computer education from Grade I to Grade X. The highly qualified teachers impart the knowledge of computers and fully equip the students for the challenges of the computer age.</p>
    <p>A dedicated broadband Internet connection in the Lab provides Internet access to source the websites for educational materials. Computer sessions and Internet access are monitored and supervised by computer teachers who aid and guide the
      children through the sessions.</p>
    <p>In computer education, emphasis is on concept formation rather than merely providing information. At primary and middle level, the students are trained to use computers with focus on application software like Logo and Paint. They are also
      trained to use MS-Office applications like MS-Word, MS-Excel, MS-PowerPoint, MS-FrontPage and Flash. Students are given hands-on experience to work on these soft wares. Secondary school students are introduced to HTML programming.</p><br>
    <h3>Science Lab</h3>
    <p>The Science Lab provides an atmosphere of experiencing and learning science. A modern Science lab, which can accommodate more than fifty students, is available.</p>
    <p>The Science lab also provides an open environment for students to experiment and do research work. Under the professional guidance and assistance given by our science teachers, students are also encouraged to exhibit their innovative powers by
      developing samples and models.</p>
    <p>Our Science lab is highly sophisticated and fully equipped to meet the curriculum requirements for Physics, Chemistry and Biology.</p>
    <p>There are numerous preserved biological specimens to observe and study, widening the exposure of students to the world of Biology.</p>
    <p>The state of the art equipment for Physics allows students to perform experiments and study various principles and laws. The facilities and wide range of chemicals and apparatus allow the students a hands-on experience in learning Chemistry.
